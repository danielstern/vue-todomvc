            <!-- Here the v:on attribute is used, which is used to respond to any event. In this case, when the "click" event happens, it causes the value of showComplete to be changed. It is attached here to the label. -->

            <!-- This list group contains a Vue repeater.-->
            <ul class="list-group">


                <!-- To give Vue a hint so that it can track each nodeâ€™s identity, and thus reuse and reorder existing elements, you need to provide a unique key attribute for each item. An ideal value for key would be the unique id of each item. This special attribute is a rough equivalent to track-by in 1.x, but it works like an attribute, so you need to use v-bind to bind it to dynamic values (using shorthand here):
                e.g.
                <div v-for="item in items" :key="item.id">-->
                 <!-- content -->
                <!-- </div>
                It is recommended to provide a key with v-for whenever possible, unless the iterated DOM content is simple, or you are intentionally relying on the default behavior for performance gains. --> 
                <!-- The v-for attribute that we see here repeats whatever tag it is on (in this case, a LI) one time for each element of the referenced list, which in this case is our list. Each repetition, the property has a different value.  -->
                <li v-for="value in filteredTodos" :key="value.id" class="list-group-item" >
                    <label class="form-check-label ml-4">

                                <!-- v-bind is used to change the value of HTML attributes, in this case the class attribute. -->
                                <span v-bind:class="{completed: value.completed}">
                                    <!-- Here we see an example of Vue's {{ }} syntax, which is quite familiar to any Angular or Handlebars users.-->
